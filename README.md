# Echo!

This is a simple echo app to accompany the K8S course in develeap.
It'll echo back what's sent to it via the `input` param in the querystring.
Optionally, it can be configured to persist the request log to MongoDB.

You talk, we talk back!


For this project the application has been modified. The original application code can be found at - https://gitlab.com/fatliverfreddy/echo
